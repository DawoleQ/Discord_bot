A discord bot made by me (still in development)
Made in discord.py 2.0 and requires python 3.8

For it to work on your PC you have to create a .env file in the bot's root directory (where main.py is)
in there you have to add two variables: TOKEN and OWNER_ID like so:
TOKEN = 'your_bot_token_here'
OWNER_ID = bot_owner_id_here

Also, you should add your bot to a server with the "bot" and "applications.commands" scopes
you should also enable all intents for your bot (All of this is done on the discord developer portal [But you probably already know that hehe])

For now it does literally nothing XD you can use this as an template
