A discord bot made by me (still in development)

For it to work on your PC you have to create a .env file in the bot's root directory (where main.py is)
in there you have to add two variables: TOKEN and OWNER_ID like so:
TOKEN = 'your_bot_token_here'
OWNER_ID = bot_owner_id

For now it does literally nothing XD you can use this as an template
