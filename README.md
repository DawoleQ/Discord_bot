Hello!!!!!!!!!
This is a tutorial repo for discord.py rewrite.
(This tutorial repo is not finished yet. You will have to wait for that :D)

What you need:
    -python 3.8 (I use python 3.8.10 specifically)
    -discord.py with voice (run "pip install discord.py[voice]")
    -dotenv (run "pip install python-dotenv")

What is included:
    -A well commented and readable code showing you how to do basic and more complicated things in discord.py
    -Cog implementation
    -Simple json data managment

How to start:
    -First, create your application and the bot. You can do that here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

    -Second, create a .env file in the bot's root directory (where main.py is) the file has "no name", it's just .env

    -Third, in the .env file you created, make 2 variables: TOKEN and OWNER_ID like so:
        TOKEN = 'token_here'
        OWNER_ID = owner_id_here

    -Then, read the files and the comments carefully and try to understand how this all works.

    -When you're done with that, try to run the bot by typing "python main.py" in the terminal, see how it works for yourself.

    -And last but not least, have fun with it! Once you're done checking this repo out, add more commands, functionality and style to the bot. Whatever comes to mind!
        If you have a idea, but don't know how to put it into code, check out the docs, search through the internet or you can even ask me directly! If I know the solution to your problem, I'll definitely help!

        You can find the docs here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
        Or ask me on discord: DawoleQ#3486

Well, off you go now! Have fun with discord.py rewrite!!! ❤️
